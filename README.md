# 📊 Data Analysis Learning Journey

Welcome to my data analysis learning journey! 👋  
This repository documents my progress as I learn the skills, tools, and methods needed to become a data analyst starting completely from scratch.
With no prior experience in data, I'm teaching myself step by step through projects and tutorials online.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies I'm Learning

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- **Excel** (cleaning, pivot tables, dashboards)
- **Tableau** *(coming soon)*
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration
